Yoda,https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/Yoda-Retina_2a7ecc26.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C1536%2C864,"Yoda was a legendary Jedi Master and stronger than most in his connection with the Force. Small in size but wise and powerful, he trained Jedi for over 800 years, playing integral roles in the Clone Wars, the instruction of Luke Skywalker, and unlocking the path to immortality."
Luke Skywalker,https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/luke-skywalker-main_7ffe21c7.jpeg?region=130%2C147%2C1417%2C796,"Luke Skywalker was a Tatooine farmboy who rose from humble beginnings to become one of the greatest Jedi the galaxy has ever known. Along with his friends Princess Leia and Han Solo, Luke battled the evil Empire, discovered the truth of his parentage, and ended the tyranny of the Sith. A generation later, the location of the famed Jedi master was one of the galaxy’s greatest mysteries. Haunted by Ben Solo’s fall to evil and convinced the Jedi had to end, Luke sought exile on a distant world, ignoring the galaxy’s pleas for help. But his solitude would be interrupted – and Luke Skywalker had one final, momentous role to play in the struggle between good and evil."
Han Solo,https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/han-solo-main_a4c8ff79.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C1920%2C1080,"Han Solo rose from an impoverished childhood on the mean streets of Corellia to become one of the heroes of the Rebel Alliance. As captain of the Millennium Falcon, Han and his co-pilot Chewbacca came to believe in the cause of galactic freedom, joining Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa in the fight against the Empire. After the Battle of Endor, Han faced difficult times in a chaotic galaxy, leading to a shattering confrontation with his estranged son Ben."

Mace Windu,https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/Mace-Windu_b35242e5.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C1637%2C921,"A grim Jedi Master with an amethyst-bladed lightsaber, Mace Windu was the champion of the Jedi Order, with little tolerance for the failings of the Senate, the arguments of politicians, or the opinions of rebellious Jedi. As the Clone Wars intensified, Mace sensed the dark side of the Force at work, and knew the Jedi's enemies were plotting to destroy the Order and end its stewardship of the galaxy."
Poe Dameron,https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/poe-main_611e1021.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C1280%2C720,"A Resistance starfighter ace, Poe Dameron is one of Leia Organa’s most-trusted operatives. He can fly anything – which is fortunate given how often his headstrong nature leads him into trouble. Poe leads the attack that destroys Starkiller Base, but soon finds himself on the run from the First Order. Sidelined without his beloved X-wing, he learns tough lessons about leadership, heroism and sacrifice. Those lessons will prove essential in rebuilding the Resistance before a showdown with the forces of evil at Exegol."
Anakin Skywalker,https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/anakin-skywalker-main_23e5105b.jpeg?region=387%2C27%2C1350%2C760,"Discovered as a slave on Tatooine by Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker had the potential to become one of the most powerful Jedi ever. Some even believed he was the prophesied Chosen One who would bring balance to the Force. Always pushing the limits of his Jedi training, seeking to excel and live up to his reputation, Skywalker's passion often brought him into conflict with his mentor, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. A hero of the Clone Wars, Anakin was caring and compassionate, but suffered from a deep fear of loss that would prove to be his downfall. "
Rey,https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/rey-main_ca4bb0d7.jpeg?region=180%2C0%2C951%2C536,"Seemingly abandoned by her parents on Jakku, Rey grew up a scavenger amid the wreckage of war. Her life changed when she agreed to help a droid on an urgent mission for the Resistance. Rey discovered she was powerful in the Force, and sought out the vanished Jedi Master Luke Skywalker to train her. That ended in disappointment, as did her attempt to bring Kylo Ren back to the light. But the resilient Rey continued her training and learned the truth about her parentage and her mysterious connection with Kylo. She then faced her greatest test: a confrontation with fear and evil that would determine the galaxy’s fate."

Jango Fett,https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/databank_jangofett_01_169_884cefab.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C1560%2C878,"In the final years of the Republic, Jango Fett was regarded as the best bounty hunter in the galaxy. A proficient marksman and unarmed combatant, Fett was covered in a sleek armored suit that concealed his scarred face. His combat gear featured an arsenal of weaponry, including retractable wrist blades, a snare, dual blaster pistols and other more exotic tools of the trade. In combat, Jango used his harnessed jetpack to gain the advantage of speed and height over his enemies. The backpack also carried a nasty surprise -- an explosive rocket could be launched from it. For interstellar travel, Jango traveled aboard his well-worn starship, Slave I."
Boba Fett,https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/boba-fett-main_a8fade4d.jpeg?region=203%2C34%2C1077%2C606,"With his customized Mandalorian armor, deadly weaponry, Boba Fett was once regarded as one of the most fearsome and capable bounty hunters in the galaxy. An unaltered genetic clone of his father, bounty hunter Jango Fett, Boba learned combat and martial skills from a young age. Over the course of his career, which included contracts for the Empire and the criminal underworld, he became a legend. Although Fett seemingly met his demise in the Sarlacc pit on Tatooine after falling into the Great Pit of Carkoon, Boba survived the beast and lived to reclaim his armor, taking over the throne at Jabba's Palace."
Darth Maul,https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/Darth-Maul_632eb5af.jpeg?region=75%2C42%2C1525%2C858,"A deadly, agile Sith Lord trained by the evil Darth Sidious, Darth Maul was a formidable warrior and scheming mastermind. He wielded an intimidating double-bladed lightsaber and fought with a menacing ferocity. Though he fell in battle against Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Zabrak from Dathomir would prove to be much harder to destroy than originally believed."
General Grievous,https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/General-Grievous_c9df9cb5.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C1200%2C675,"General Grievous was a brilliant Separatist military strategist and a feared Jedi hunter, known for his ruthlessness and hacking cough. His body itself was a weapon, allowing him lightning quick strikes and devastating blows. But he was also quick to run from a fight, a tactic that worked until one final meeting with Obi-Wan Kenobi."
Plo Koon,https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/databank_plokoon_01_169_92e6679c.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C1560%2C878,"A Kel Dor from Dorin, Plo Koon was among the wisest members of the Jedi Order, respected for his level-headed analysis of events and unflappable calm. Deeply concerned for life in all its myriad forms, Plo was especially devoted to protecting the clones under his command. He shared a special bond with Ahsoka Tano, whom he’d brought to the Jedi Order as a toddler. One of many victims of Order 66, Master Plo died at Cato Neimoidia when his wingmen shot down his starfighter."

He is at home in the waters of aquatic planets, like his native Glee Anselm. As a Jedi Master, Fisto has an intense focus, particularly in combat. He is also much more laid back and capable of enjoying a hearty chuckle than some of his humorless colleagues."

Shortly after the Empire's creation, he was put in charge of the construction of the Death Star. Tarkin saw the Death Star as a way to crush all dissent to the Empire's rule -- fear of the station's planet-killing superlaser would keep the galaxy's star systems in line. He demonstrated the station's power by destroying Alderaan, but died soon afterwards when the Death Star itself was destroyed."
Nute Gunray,https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/databank_nutegunray_01_169_9d66ded2.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C1560%2C878,"Neimoidians are known for their business skills, but Nute Gunray, Viceroy of the Trade Federation, was more cutthroat than most. It was Gunray who conspired with the Sith Lord Darth Sidious to launch the blockade and subsequent invasion of Naboo. Once the planet was under siege, Gunray attempted to force Queen Amidala to sign a treaty that would legitimize the occupation. Amidala escaped, and returned to infiltrate her own palace and blast through Gunray's protectors. Arrested by Republic officials, Gunray was carted off to answer for his crimes, but evaded imprisonment and kept his post."

Leia Organa,https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/leia-organa-main_9af6ff81.jpeg?region=187%2C157%2C1400%2C786,"Princess Leia Organa was one of the greatest leaders of the Rebel Alliance, fearless on the battlefield and dedicated to ending the Empire’s tyranny. Daughter of Padmé Amidala and Anakin Skywalker, sister of Luke Skywalker, and with a soft spot for scoundrels, Leia ranked among the galaxy’s great heroes. But life under the New Republic proved difficult for her. Sidelined by a new generation of political leaders, she struck out on her own to oppose the First Order as founder of the Resistance. These setbacks in her political career were accompanied by more personal losses, which she endured with her seemingly inexhaustible will."

Scheming, powerful, and evil to the core, Darth Sidious restored the Sith and destroyed the Jedi Order. Living a double life, he was also Palpatine, a Naboo Senator and phantom menace. He manipulated the political system of the Galactic Republic until he was named Supreme Chancellor -- and eventually Emperor – and ruled the galaxy through fear and tyranny.

Their skeletal structure is extremely flexible, as it is made of cartilaginous material rather than hard bone. The long Gungan face has a tough yet flexible bill for burrowing and rooting out food. They have long muscular tongues with which they scoop mollusks and lesser amphibians from the Naboo swamps. While most spacefarers would dismiss Gungans as primitives, they have developed an advanced technology."

Tagge was not aboard the Death Star when it exploded over Yavin; acknowledging that Tagge had been correct about the rebel threat, the Emperor promoted him to Grand General and placed him in charge of the Imperial military."
